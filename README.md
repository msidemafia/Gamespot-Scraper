# Gamespot-Scraper 

(this app actually scrapes "The Onion" website because Gamespot doesn't allow Heroku hosted apps to scrape their site)

Anyway, using this app you can scrape (The Onion)'s website and pull the latest articles. If you wish, you can also save your favorite articles and view them later. 
Also, add and save any comments about the saved article you would like.

NPM packages used:

Express
Express-handlebars
